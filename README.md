# Blubs-EvolutionSim

My name is Reed Bryan, and I am currently a software engineering undergrad at the University of Victoria. This is a project I made back in high school, but I still think its quite cool. The idea was to simulate the process of evolution by spawning a bunch of animals (blubs) into a basic customizable environment. Each blub has some survival logic like find food, eat smaller blubs, run from bigger blubs. They also have their own genetics, meaning some coefficient determining how fast they can run, their size, how much they need to eat before reproducing, etc. Each blub has a constantly depleting energy level which can only be increased by eating. If this number ever reaches zero they die. But if their energy passes a certain threshold, they will create a copy of themselves aka they will reproduce. Upon reproduction the child may spawn with a mutation. Meaning thereâ€™s a small chance each stat is either grown or depleted. Over time this process was supposed to create the optimal species to fit the environment and prove evolution is real. I am no biologist however, so this rarely happened but the species does tent to change even if not for the better. I've always been fascinated by the theory of evolution and am just happy I was able to make some small working version.

Hope you enjoy
